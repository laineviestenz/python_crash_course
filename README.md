This repository holds the excercises from Python Crash Course (1st edition), specifically Part I.
After chapter 11 (end of Part I), I switched to a digital version of Python Crash Course (3rd edition) which contains updated projects using modern libraries.
Due to the 3rd edition being a digital version with a one-day-at-a-time loan, I also include some of the book's worked examples for future reference.

*Artifiical Inteligence was used to answer a limited number of specific questions, but all code is 100% human generated.
