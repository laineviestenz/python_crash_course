This repository holds the excercises from Python Crash Course (1st edition), specifically Part I. Chapters 1 and 2 are ommitted as I already had python experience before starting the book. Part II may be added later, but I will 
likely find a newer book to do the projects out of, to avoid the risk of learning outdated techniques and libraries.

*Artifiical Inteligence was used to answer a limited number of specific questions, but all code is 100% human generated.
